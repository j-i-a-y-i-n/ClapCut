          <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
          <p> In all film analysis classes, a classic activity is to watch a short scene, and to clap each time we see a cut. On screen, each cut is silent, and because of classical editing, easily go unnoticed. By having to clapping, us students become more aware of each cut, and therefore, the director’s choices. As a group activity, the claps becomes an audible recording for us to hear – like terrible music – the pacing and patterns of the cuts. </p>
          <p>This activity becomes more enjoyable when contrasting between extreme styles of editing. For example, Citizen Kane (1941) is known for its extensive use of long takes, and often the class did not have to clap for entire minutes. Shot reverse shots occur more frequently. Action packed scenes tend to have quicker pacing, some shots lasting less then a second, and in rapid fire frequency. The cuts of music videos, in particular, always synch to the beats of the music behind, resulting in a relatively steady pace. </p>
          <p>What I want to make is a visual representation that mimics that classroom activity. My database is from <a href="http://www.cinemetrics.lv/">Cinemetrics</a>, which is a software that records the viewer’s clicks as he or she watches the film. While this method of recording is not the most accurate since viewers often click more than once out of habit, or miss a click because they become too engrossed in the movie, it is extremely reflective of the older practices of film analysis when digital or analog media haven’t arrived yet and film critics counted shots and described them in real time of a theatre screening. It is also reflective of the viewer experience in how we perceive a cut. For example, a cut in Birdman (2014) would not been plotted because its cuts have been seamlessly edited for the film to look as if it was one long take instead </p>
          <p>However, other attempts, such as Cinemetrics’, to visualize this data falls under the problem of scale. If all the cuts of an entire movie is presented at once, the details are too fine to be seen. If the cuts of just a 1 minute sequence is presented, then an overall pattern cannot be seen either. Hence, these visualizations must be able to adjust its scale for exploration – zoom in, zoom out, and pan left and right.  </p>
          <p>While, I initially wanted to create a simple timeline with various sized bars stacked next to each other to represent each cut and its duration, it proved impossible because such stacked bar charts would need me to plot each cut by itself. </p>
          <p>Instead, a better method turned out to be much simpler. That is, forming a line graph where the line represents the progression of the film, each dot represents a cut, and each dot’s size is proportional to the duration of time that has elapsed since the previous cut. This was plotted on a simple graph, which means the y axis ticks doesn’t mean anything since the y-variable is simply the film name.  </p>
